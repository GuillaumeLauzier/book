# book

This Swift code defines a class called Book that represents a book with several properties such as title, author, publisher, isbn, and year. It also has an initializer method to set the properties of the instance.

A generic class Stack is also defined with a type parameter T. The Stack class has an array property called things of type T. The Stack class also has a method add which adds an element of type T to the things array.

Instances of the Book class are created, and added to an instance of the Stack class, stackBooks. The for loop iterates over the stackBooks.things array and prints the title of each Book instance.

In detail, stackBooks is an instance of the generic class Stack, with the type parameter of Book. It is initialized as an empty array. Then, three instances of the Book class, petitPrince, animalFarm, and barackObama, are created with specific properties, and added to stackBooks with the add method of Stack class.

Finally, a for loop is used to iterate through the things array of the stackBooks instance, which contains the Book instances, and prints the title of each Book instance.

In summary, the code demonstrates the use of a generic class and its associated methods to create a stack of Book instances, and then iterating over the stack to perform some operation.
